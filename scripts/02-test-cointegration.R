#' # 3. Spread Data 
#' Data was previous gathered in tidy format. For preliminary analysis, filter data to daily time resolution and data after 
#' April 1, 2017. Based on some exploratory analysis, the number of cointegrated coins rapidly increased after April 1, 2017. 
#' This time period coincides with an extremely rapid rise of bitcoin (starting from roughly $1100) and many other coins.

#' # 4. Cointegration Function 
#' The Engle-Granger method is used to test for cointegration. This method is comprised of two steps:  (1) Perform a linear 
#' regression of coin_y on coin_x. (2) Perform an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the residuals from the linear regression 
#' estimated in (1). The ADF test assumes a non-zero mean but no time-based trend. The function returns the Dickey-Fuller 
#' test statistic, the critical values at 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, and the half-life of mean reversion assuming 
#' that the mean reversion follows a Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. Note that the p-value is calculated from a distribution where 
#' the linear regression coefficients are not estimated from the data. Since the regression coefficients are estimated from 
#' the data, the p-value is biased downward, so interpretation of the p-value relative to critical values should be done with 
#' caution.  
#' 
#' Other methods considered were the Johansen test and the Phillips-Ouliaris cointegration test. Using different methods may 
#' lead to different conclusions when looking at test statistics relative to critical values.

#' # 5. Create Coin Combinations 
#' Two sets of currency pairs are examined: currency pairs where USDT is the quote currency and currency pairs where BTC 
#' is the quote currency. All combinations of coins within each set of currency pairs are created. Combinations that consist 
#' of the coin with itself are removed. There are a total of 98 coin combinations.

#' # 6. Test Cointegration on All Coin Pairs 
#' The Engle-Granger method is tested on all coin combinations generated above. The Dickey-Fuller statistic, critical values at 
#' the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent level, and the half-life of mean reversion for each coin combination are generated. 
#' Of the 98 coin combinations, 11 of the coins have a p-value of less than 10 percent. Most of these coins have a half-life of 
#' mean reversion of less than 10 days. However, many of the highly cointegrated coin pairs are comprised of coins that may 
#' individually exhiibt some stationarity. See BTC_DASH for example. If an individual coin is stationary, any trivial combination 
#' of that coin with another coin could be made stationary as well.
