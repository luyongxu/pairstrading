#' # 1. Capture Command Line Arguments 
#' This script when called through the command line using Rscript has the option of including a debug argument 
#' indicating whether to be verbose in the output or not to aid in debugging package dependency errors.  
args_debug <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) 
if (length(args_debug) == 0) { 
  debug <- FALSE 
} else if (args_debug[1] == "debug") { 
  debug <- TRUE
}

#' # 2. Print Library Paths and Packages
#' The .libPaths() function returns the libraries that R looks in to load packages. There are differences in the 
#' library path folder list when running scripts using Rscript and running scripts using RStudio. This section 
#' explicitly prints out the library path and the installed packages in each directory to aid in debugging any 
#' problems regarding loading packages and loading package dependencies.  
if (debug == TRUE) { 
  print("The following directories are in the library path: ")
  print(.libPaths())
  cat("\n")
  for (i in .libPaths()) { 
    print(paste("The following packages are installed in", i, ":"))
    print(rownames(installed.packages(lib.loc = i)))
    cat("\n")
  }
}

#' # 3. Load Libraries 
#' The RStudio Server Amazon Machine Image provided by Louis Aslett (http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/) provides 
#' an easy way to start an ec2 instance with RStudio Server and all major libraries installed. This machine image installs 
#' packages in the "/home/rstudio/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4" directory. When running scripts using Rscript in the 
#' command line, however, this directory is not present in the library path. This section adds the folder to the library 
#' path. 
#' 
#' Each library may depend on certain dependencies are those dependencies are loaded first before loading the parent 
#' library. When library dependencies are loaded, they may also be looking in incorrect library paths and may cause 
#' the parent library to not load. If this happens, load the dependencies manually first before loading the parent 
#' library.  
library_path <- c("/home/rstudio/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4", .libPaths())
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages({
  library(cli, lib.loc = library_path)

#' # 4. Print Session Info 
#' A debugging step used to verify that all libraries have been loaded properly.
